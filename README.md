# Rock_Paper_Scissors
A mini-proj using JS fundamentals such as functions, if-else statements, event listeners
This project was initiated after learning core concepts of JavaScript and basic HTML and CSS applications. 
Rock Paper Scissors is a game where two players choose from any three options and try to beat the other on a points based system.
Rock beats scissors, scissors, beats paper and paper beats rock. 
Initially, the logic and flow of the game was produced using alert prompts. The raw code has also been provided and commented out in the base of the JS file.
This code is quite extensive and repititive- perhaps it could be made more concise with case statements. 
In order to be more aesthetically pleasing, the game was transformed into click button icons for each choice with animations. 
Instead of the user typing their choice as string text in the alert prompt which would carry additional code for numeric/punctuation, special characters etc., click buttons are provided.
A score counter and game message is also provided.
